squeezen - Squeezebox remote console for text mode terminals.

2013, Juerd Waalboer

    apt-get install libcurses-ui-perl liburi-perl perl-modules perl
    perl squeezen.pl

Hacked together in a few hours; please forgive me for writing ugly code.
Especially the music folder browser code is terrifying.

We're using it on an old IBM 3151 terminal at RevSpace, the hackerspace in
The Hague. Come visit us to see it in action :-)
